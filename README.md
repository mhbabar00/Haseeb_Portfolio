## Projects

### Project 1: Market Basket Analysis

**Purpose:** Finding out which product pairs sell the most to promote product bundling and attract more customers!

**Dataset Description:** The data is taken from an excel file called "Groceries_data" downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset/data). It contains 38765 rows of purchase orders with columns:

- __Members_number:__ The unique number ID for each customer.
- __Date:__ The date of the purchase in the format ___dd-mm-yyyy___.
- __itemDescription:__ The grocery item purchased.

**Features:** In this analysis, I employed two techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between variables.
