## Projects

### [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of Amazon Products](https://github.com/mhbabar00/Haseeb_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Amazon_dataset_project.ipynb)

**Purpose:** Finding out the popularity of Amazon Products based upon user ratings and how do factors like Categories, Price and Discounts affect the ratings? 

**Dataset Description:** The data is taken from an excel file called "Amazon.csv" downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedsayed564/amazon-sales-dataset). It contains 1465 rows of products offered by Amazon with columns:

- ___product_id___ - Product ID
- ___product_name___ - Name of the Product
- ___category___ - Category of the Product
- ___discounted_price___ - Discounted Price of the Product
- ___actual_price___ - Actual Price of the Product
- ___discount_percentage___ - Percentage of Discount for the Product
- ___rating___ - Rating of the Product
- ___rating_count___ - Number of people who voted for the Amazon rating
- ___about_product___ - Description about the Product
- ___user_id___ - ID of the user who wrote review for the Product
- ___user_name___ - Name of the user who wrote review for the Product
- ___review_id___ - ID of the user review
- ___review_title___ - Short review
- ___review_content___ - Long review
- ___img_link___ - Image Link of the Product
- ___product_link___ - Official Website Link of the Product

**Features:** In this analysis, I first cleaned and prepared the data for Data Analysis to remove any special characters and missing values then I used Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to answer the questions asked in the purpose.


### [Project 2: Market Basket Analysis of Groceries](https://github.com/mhbabar00/Haseeb_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/grocery_data_project.ipynb)

**Purpose:** Finding out which product pairs sell the most to promote product bundling and attract more customers!

**Dataset Description:** The data is taken from an excel file called "Groceries_data" downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset/data). It contains 38765 rows of purchase orders with columns:

- __Members_number:__ The unique number ID for each customer.
- __Date:__ The date of the purchase in the format ___dd-mm-yyyy___.
- __itemDescription:__ The grocery item purchased.

**Features:** In this analysis, I employed two techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between variables.
